The MountainCar problem

A car is positioned in a valley between two mountains. The goal is to drive up the mountain on the right, but the car's engine is not powerful enough to propel it to the top
of the mountain. The car must build up momentum in order to scale the right-side mountain by rolling back and forth between the two.

This problem has a continuous state space. States can be bucketed or grouped together to discretize the space.
